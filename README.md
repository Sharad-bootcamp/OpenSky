Project 3

The data provided by Seek was initially shared as private insights, available for free. These insights were obtained in response to a job advertisement campaign that lasted for a duration of 10 days in April 2018.

Upon meticulous data cleaning to enhance our comprehension, we have drawn the following key conclusions:

Geographical Concentration: The bulk of the job offerings are heavily concentrated within the top five cities, namely Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.
Diverse Demand: Further analysis has shown the varying job category preferences across each of the five prominent cities. When focusing on Adelaide, where a substantial portion of our peers reside, we've noticed that the 'Information and Communication Tech' category ranks fourth, comprising roughly 80 posted job offers. In contrast, this category takes the lead in Sydney, boasting nearly 16 times the count of Adelaide. Moreover, it secures the second position in Melbourne with a significant 750 job listings.
Optimal Timing: Our analysis has also revealed the ideal time for job seekers to commence their search. Prior to this analysis, the presumption might have been that most jobs are posted around midday, however, our findings contradict this. Instead, most of the job opportunities tend to surge between 10 pm and 7 am on the following day.
In summary, these findings provide valuable insights for job seekers and employers alike. They suggest that individuals seeking employment should focus on the key cities mentioned and tailor their job searches to the specific preferences of each city. Additionally, the findings emphasize the importance of considering timing when conducting job searches, as opportunities may be more abundant during late evening and early morning hours.
