# OpenSky - Project 3

The data provided by Aviation Edge API was available paying a fee suscription. These insights were obtained from live tracking flights to actual airport schedules, airline routes aggregated from our various data partners around the world and presented to our clients through Flight Radar API.

Upon meticulous data modelling to enhance our comprehension, we have drawn the following key conclusions:

# *Geographical Concentration: 
The bulk of the flights are heavily concentrated within the top five cities, namely Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.
# *Rate Limits: 
Users of the Aviation Edge API need to be mindful of rate limits, which restrict the number of requests within specific timeframes. Exceeding these limits may lead to temporary blocks or usage restrictions. It's essential to plan requests carefully and efficiently to avoid disruptions in service.
# * Data Freshness: 
While the API provides real-time data, it's important to acknowledge that there might be slight delays due to the processing and updating of information. Users should be aware of this delay when relying on the API for time-sensitive applications and make appropriate allowances for potential lag.
# *Limited Free Tier: 
The API offers a free-tier plan, but it may come with limitations in terms of access and features. Users looking for additional or advanced functionalities should consider subscribing to a paid plan. Careful evaluation of their specific needs and budget is advised to make an informed choice.
# *Data Coverage: 
The API's coverage of certain data types, such as airports, airlines, and flights, as well as geographical regions, may vary. Some data may be more comprehensive in specific areas compared to others. Users should assess whether the available data aligns with their requirements.
# *Limited Customer Support for Free Tiers: 
Free-tier users of the API might experience limited access to customer support. Responses from support may take longer compared to paid users who typically receive higher priority assistance. This should be considered when evaluating the level of support needed for your use case.
